# Scene Setup

We are going to create a simple Scene, only a few steps.

Open the Game scene we created in a previous step.

* Create a '3D Object / Plane'
* set the y position to -0.5
* Set a material so plane does not appear only white

Adding Server Setup

* Right click in hierarchy and click on 'NetPad / Server (Game) + Discovery' no furhter setting to make
* In your project search for the 'WebServerCanvas' prefab and drag and drop in into the hierarchy



Spawner

* Create an empty GameObject and add the previous created script 'BallSpawner'
* Drag n drop the Ball prefab into the field

Save your scene.
