# Project Setup

1. Import the NetPad asset, if you haven't already done so.
2.  Establish a well-organized folder structure by separating game and client components, and consider creating additional folders for shared code and assets. You can also use an existing feature to generate this folder structure.

3. Navigate to the Game/Scenes folder and create a new empty scene, naming it "Game."
4. Proceed to the Controller/Scenes folder and generate another new empty scene, this time naming it "Controller."
