# Build Pipeline

A custom build pipeline for a Unity project, specifically designed to streamline the build process for the NetPad application.&#x20;

The build pipeline automates the building of both the game (server) and the controller (client), allowing for faster iterations during development.

By providing customizable build settings and options for clearing the destination folder, copying the controller to the StreamingAssets folder, and running the game's first scene after a successful build, the build pipeline enhances the development workflow in NetPad.&#x20;

This ensures that developers can efficiently test and iterate on their controller and server implementations, reducing the time spent on manual build processes and increasing overall productivity.
